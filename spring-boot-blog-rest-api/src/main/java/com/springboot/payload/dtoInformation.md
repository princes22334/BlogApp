Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) 
especially when dealing with REST APIs. They play a key role in separating the data
accessed by the application's core logic (domain model) from the data exposed 
to external clients (REST API responses, UI presentations, etc.). 
Here's a breakdown of their role and benefits in Spring Boot:





Advantage of Using DTO's
1. It helps to Hide implementation of jpa entities.
2. Only returns data that is required for the Client.


What are DTOs?

DTOs are lightweight classes that hold specific data needed for a particular purpose, 
like interacting with the API or displaying on the UI.
They typically contain a smaller subset of fields compared to their corresponding domain entities, 
focusing on data relevant to the specific context.
DTOs can be designed to be:
Immutable: Cannot be modified after creation, promoting data consistency.
Flat: Avoid nested objects to simplify data transfer and manipulation.
Serializable: Enables easy transmission over network or persistence.
Benefits of using DTOs in Spring Boot:

Decoupling: Isolates the domain model from external concerns like API and UI, allowing 
independent development and changes.
Encapsulation: Hides internal details of domain entities, protecting them from unauthorized modification.
Performance: Reduces data transfer size by sending only relevant data, optimizing network communication.
Clarity: Improves code readability by explicitly defining data used for specific purposes.
Validation: Facilitates customized validation rules applied to specific DTO fields, distinct from entity validation.
